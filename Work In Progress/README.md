Implementing FixUp:- Initialization method that does not use BatchNorm.

- [ ] Implement Wide Resnet based on official implementation
- [ ] Complete my GAN implementations with BatchNorm and compare them with the GAN with FixUp
- [ ] Compile everything into .py files for direct implementation
- [ ] Comment out the notebook explaining the implementations
- [ ] Make a Medium post and possible Youtube video
