# pytorch_projects
Collection of my implementations of various papers and the stuff I like.

__Note__:- This is still a new repo and I will update the contents at the same time I complete Semantic Segmentation models.
I am planning to make a seperate repo or a subfolder in this repo to contain all the classes of the models for simple importing. Will see about it with Semantic models also.
